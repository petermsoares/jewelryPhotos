Antique Victorian 14k Gold Banded Agate Star Stickpin
$165.00

Gorgeous hard to find Victorian 14k Gold Carved Stars Banded Agate Stickpin. From an estate and in completely original condition. Somewhere along the way it was jeweler marked 14K; it is also tested and guaranteed to be solid 14K gold both head AND stick. Original, authentic mid 1800s and beautifully hand made.

The carved banded agate stone is stunning. It has a deeply carved flower star in the black layer of the banding amid a more sharply defined carved star in the white layer of the banding. Accenting the central carving is the grayish black level of banding which is carved with tiny stars around the perimeter. This agate was then carefully housed in a lovely 14K gold bezel with a hand twisted and wrapped 14K gold frame. Absolutely gorgeous antique Victorian hand crafting and use of fine quality materials that you no longer see today.

Other than a very small age/use fingernail crease on the upper back and a small age bend in the stick it is in excellent condition. Size is 2 1/2″ tall North to South. The head is 5/8″ by 1/2″. This is an impressive and hard to find carved agate for your Victorian gold stickpin jewelry collection.
